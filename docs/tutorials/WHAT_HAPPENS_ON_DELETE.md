# What Happens When You DELETE a Row?

This tutorial traces what happens when a `DELETE` statement hits a base table that is referenced by a stream table. It covers the trigger capture, how the scan delta emits a single DELETE event, and how each DVM operator propagates the removal — including group deletion, partial group reduction, JOINs, cascading deletes within a single refresh window, and the important edge case where a DELETE cancels a prior INSERT.

> **Prerequisite:** Read [WHAT_HAPPENS_ON_INSERT.md](WHAT_HAPPENS_ON_INSERT.md) first — it introduces the full 7-phase lifecycle (trigger → scheduler → frontier → change detection → DVM delta → MERGE → cleanup). This tutorial focuses on how DELETE differs.

## Setup

Same e-commerce example used throughout the series:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id       SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount   NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL
);

SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'customer_totals',
    $$
      SELECT customer, SUM(amount) AS total, COUNT(*) AS order_count
      FROM orders GROUP BY customer
    $$,
    '1m',
    'DIFFERENTIAL'
);

-- Seed some data
INSERT INTO orders (customer, amount) VALUES
    ('alice', 50.00),
    ('alice', 30.00),
    ('bob',   75.00),
    ('bob',   25.00);
```

After the first refresh, the stream table contains:

```
customer | total  | order_count
---------|--------|------------
alice    | 80.00  | 2
bob      | 100.00 | 2
```

---

## Case 1: Delete One Row (Group Survives)

```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 2;  -- alice's 30.00 order
```

Alice still has one remaining order (id=1, amount=50.00). The group shrinks but doesn't vanish.

### Phase 1: Trigger Capture

The AFTER DELETE trigger fires and writes **one row** to the change buffer with only OLD values:

```
pgtrickle_changes.changes_16384
┌───────────┬─────────────┬────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ change_id │ lsn         │ action │ new_cust │ new_amt  │ old_cust   │ old_amt  │ pk_hash    │
├───────────┼─────────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ 5         │ 0/1A3F3000  │ D      │ NULL     │ NULL     │ alice      │ 30.00    │ 4521038    │
└───────────┴─────────────┴────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────────┘
```

Key difference from INSERT and UPDATE:
- **`new_*` columns are all NULL** — the row no longer exists, so there are no NEW values
- **`old_*` columns contain the deleted row's data** — this is what gets subtracted
- **`pk_hash`** is computed from `OLD.id` (the deleted row's primary key)

### Phase 2–4: Scheduler, Frontier, Change Detection

Identical to the INSERT flow. The scheduler detects one change row in the LSN window.

### Phase 5: Scan Differentiation — Pure DELETE

Unlike UPDATE (which splits into D+I), a DELETE produces a **single event**:

```
__pgt_row_id | __pgt_action | customer | amount
-------------|--------------|----------|-------
4521038      | D            | alice    | 30.00
```

The scan delta applies the net-effect filtering rule:
- `first_action = 'D'` → row existed before the refresh window
- `last_action = 'D'` → row does not exist after

Result: emit a DELETE using old values. **No INSERT is emitted** (because `last_action = 'D'`).

This is the simplest path through the scan delta — one change, one PK, one DELETE event.

### Phase 5 (continued): Aggregate Differentiation

The aggregate operator processes the DELETE event against the `alice` group:

```sql
-- DELETE event: subtract old values from alice's group
__ins_count = 0         -- no inserts
__del_count = 1         -- one deletion
__ins_total = 0         -- no amount added
__del_total = 30.00     -- 30.00 removed
```

The merge CTE joins this delta with the existing stream table state:

```
new_count = old_count + ins_count - del_count = 2 + 0 - 1 = 1  (still > 0)
```

Since `new_count > 0` and the group already existed (`old_count = 2`), the action is classified as **'U' (update)**. The aggregate emits the group with its new values:

```
customer | total | order_count | __pgt_row_id | __pgt_action
---------|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------
alice    | 50.00 | 1           | 7283194      | I
```

Note: the 'U' meta-action is emitted as `__pgt_action = 'I'` because the MERGE treats it as an update-via-INSERT (see aggregate final CTE: `CASE WHEN __pgt_meta_action = 'D' THEN 'D' ELSE 'I' END`).

### Phase 6: MERGE

The MERGE statement matches alice's existing row and updates it:

```sql
MERGE INTO customer_totals AS st
USING (...delta...) AS d
ON st.__pgt_row_id = d.__pgt_row_id
WHEN MATCHED AND d.__pgt_action = 'I' THEN
  UPDATE SET customer = d.customer, total = d.total, order_count = d.order_count, ...
```

Result:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_totals;
 customer | total  | order_count
----------|--------|------------
 alice    | 50.00  | 1            ← was 80.00 / 2
 bob      | 100.00 | 2
```

### Phase 7: Cleanup

The change buffer rows in the consumed LSN window are deleted:

```sql
DELETE FROM pgtrickle_changes.changes_16384
WHERE lsn > '0/1A3F2FFF'::pg_lsn AND lsn <= '0/1A3F3000'::pg_lsn;
```

---

## Case 2: Delete Last Row in Group (Group Vanishes)

```sql
-- Alice has one order left (id=1, amount=50.00). Delete it.
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 1;
```

### Trigger Capture

```
change_id | lsn         | action | old_cust | old_amt | pk_hash
6         | 0/1A3F3100  | D      | alice    | 50.00   | -837291
```

### Scan Delta

Single DELETE event:

```
__pgt_row_id | __pgt_action | customer | amount
-------------|--------------|----------|-------
-837291      | D            | alice    | 50.00
```

### Aggregate Delta

```
Group "alice":
  ins_count = 0
  del_count = 1
  new_count = old_count + 0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0  → group vanishes!
```

When `new_count` drops to 0 (or below), the aggregate classifies this as action **'D' (delete)**. The reference count has reached zero — no rows contribute to this group anymore.

The aggregate emits a DELETE for alice's group:

```
customer | __pgt_row_id | __pgt_action
---------|--------------|-------------
alice    | 7283194      | D
```

### MERGE

The MERGE matches alice's existing row and **deletes** it:

```sql
WHEN MATCHED AND d.__pgt_action = 'D' THEN DELETE
```

Result:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_totals;
 customer | total  | order_count
----------|--------|------------
 bob      | 100.00 | 2
```

Alice's row is completely removed from the stream table. This is the correct behavior — with zero contributing rows, the group should not exist.

---

## Case 3: Delete Multiple Rows (Same Group, Same Window)

```sql
-- Delete both of bob's orders before the next refresh
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 3;  -- bob, 75.00
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 4;  -- bob, 25.00
```

The change buffer has two rows with different pk_hash values (different PKs):

```
change_id | action | old_cust | old_amt | pk_hash
7         | D      | bob      | 75.00   | pk_hash_3
8         | D      | bob      | 25.00   | pk_hash_4
```

### Scan Delta

Each PK has exactly one change, so both take the single-change fast path:

```
__pgt_row_id | __pgt_action | customer | amount
-------------|--------------|----------|-------
pk_hash_3    | D            | bob      | 75.00
pk_hash_4    | D            | bob      | 25.00
```

Two DELETE events, both targeting bob's group.

### Aggregate Delta

The aggregate sums both deletions:

```
Group "bob":
  ins_count = 0
  del_count = 2
  del_total = 75.00 + 25.00 = 100.00
  new_count = 2 + 0 - 2 = 0  → group vanishes!
```

The aggregate emits a DELETE for bob's group.

### MERGE

Bob's row is deleted from the stream table. With both alice and bob gone (from Cases 1+2+3), the stream table is now empty.

---

## Case 4: INSERT + DELETE in Same Window (Cancellation)

What if a row is inserted and then deleted before the next refresh?

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (customer, amount) VALUES ('charlie', 200.00);
DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer = 'charlie';
```

The change buffer has:

```
change_id | action | new_cust | new_amt | old_cust | old_amt | pk_hash
9         | I      | charlie  | 200.00  | NULL     | NULL    | pk_hash_new
10        | D      | NULL     | NULL    | charlie  | 200.00  | pk_hash_new
```

### Net-Effect Computation

Both changes share the same pk_hash. The pk_stats CTE finds `cnt = 2`, so this goes through the multi-change path:

```sql
first_action = FIRST_VALUE(action) OVER (...) → 'I'
last_action  = LAST_VALUE(action)  OVER (...) → 'D'
```

The scan delta applies the net-effect filtering:
- **DELETE branch**: requires `first_action != 'I'` → FAILS (first_action = 'I')
- **INSERT branch**: requires `last_action != 'D'` → FAILS (last_action = 'D')

**Result: zero events emitted.** The INSERT and DELETE completely cancel each other out.

The aggregate never sees charlie. The stream table is unchanged. This is correct — the row was born and died within the same refresh window, so it should have no visible effect.

---

## Case 5: UPDATE + DELETE in Same Window

```sql
UPDATE orders SET amount = 999.99 WHERE id = 3;  -- bob: 75 → 999.99
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 3;
```

The change buffer:

```
change_id | action | old_amt | new_amt
11        | U      | 75.00   | 999.99
12        | D      | 999.99  | NULL
```

### Net-Effect Computation

Same pk_hash, `cnt = 2`:

```
first_action = 'U'  (row existed before this window)
last_action  = 'D'  (row no longer exists)
```

Filtering:
- **DELETE branch**: `first_action != 'I'` → OK. Emit DELETE with old values from the **earliest** change: `old_amt = 75.00`
- **INSERT branch**: `last_action != 'D'` → FAILS. No INSERT emitted.

Net delta:

```
__pgt_row_id | __pgt_action | amount
-------------|--------------|-------
pk_hash_3    | D            | 75.00
```

The intermediate value of 999.99 never appears. The aggregate sees only the removal of the **original** value (75.00), which is correct — that's the value that was previously accounted for in the stream table.

---

## Case 6: DELETE with JOINs

Consider a stream table that joins two tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    tier TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'standard'
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id),
    amount      NUMERIC(10,2)
);

SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    'order_details',
    $$
      SELECT c.name, c.tier, o.amount
      FROM orders o
      JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    $$,
    '1m',
    'DIFFERENTIAL'
);
```

Seed data:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'alice', 'premium'), (2, 'bob', 'standard');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, 1, 50.00), (2, 1, 30.00), (3, 2, 75.00);
```

After refresh, the stream table has:

```
name  | tier     | amount
------|----------|-------
alice | premium  | 50.00
alice | premium  | 30.00
bob   | standard | 75.00
```

Now delete an order:

```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 2;  -- alice's 30.00 order
```

### How the JOIN Delta Works

The join differentiation formula:

$$\Delta(L \bowtie R) = (\Delta L \bowtie R) \cup (L \bowtie \Delta R) - (\Delta L \bowtie \Delta R)$$

Since only the `orders` table changed:
- $\Delta L$ = changes to orders (one DELETE: order #2)
- $\Delta R$ = changes to customers (empty)

So:
- **Part 1**: $\Delta\text{orders} \bowtie \text{customers}$ = the deleted order joined with its customer
- **Part 2**: $\text{orders} \bowtie \Delta\text{customers}$ = empty (no customer changes)
- **Part 3**: $\Delta\text{orders} \bowtie \Delta\text{customers}$ = empty (customers unchanged)

Part 1 produces:
```
name  | tier    | amount | __pgt_action
------|---------|--------|-------------
alice | premium | 30.00  | D
```

The deleted order is joined with alice's customer record to produce a DELETE delta row with the complete joined values.

### MERGE

The MERGE matches the row `(alice, premium, 30.00)` and deletes it:

```sql
SELECT * FROM order_details;
 name  | tier     | amount
-------|----------|-------
 alice | premium  | 50.00      ← alice's remaining order
 bob   | standard | 75.00
```

### What About Deleting From the Dimension Table?

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 2;  -- remove bob entirely
```

Now $\Delta R$ has a DELETE for bob, while $\Delta L$ is empty:

- **Part 1**: $\Delta\text{orders} \bowtie \text{customers}$ = empty
- **Part 2**: $\text{orders} \bowtie \Delta\text{customers}$ = bob's order(s) joined with deleted customer record

Part 2 produces DELETE events for every order that referenced bob:

```
name | tier     | amount | __pgt_action
-----|----------|--------|-------------
bob  | standard | 75.00  | D
```

After MERGE, bob's rows vanish from the stream table.

> **Note**: This assumes referential integrity — if `orders` still references customer #2, a foreign key constraint would prevent the DELETE in practice. But from the IVM perspective, the join delta correctly handles the removal regardless.

---

## Case 7: Bulk DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE amount < 50.00;
```

This deletes multiple rows across potentially multiple groups. The trigger fires once per row (it's a `FOR EACH ROW` trigger), writing one change buffer entry per deleted row:

```
change_id | action | old_cust | old_amt | pk_hash
13        | D      | alice    | 30.00   | pk_hash_2
14        | D      | bob      | 25.00   | pk_hash_4
```

### Scan Delta

Each deleted PK is independent (different pk_hash values), so each takes the single-change fast path. Two DELETE events:

```
__pgt_row_id | __pgt_action | customer | amount
-------------|--------------|----------|-------
pk_hash_2    | D            | alice    | 30.00
pk_hash_4    | D            | bob      | 25.00
```

### Aggregate Delta

The aggregate groups these by customer:

```
Group "alice":
  del_count = 1, del_total = 30.00
  new_count = 2 - 1 = 1  (survives)

Group "bob":
  del_count = 1, del_total = 25.00
  new_count = 2 - 1 = 1  (survives)
```

Both groups survive (count > 0), so the aggregate emits UPDATE (as 'I') events with new values:

```
customer | total | order_count
---------|-------|------------
alice    | 50.00 | 1
bob      | 75.00 | 1
```

The MERGE updates both rows. **All work is proportional to the number of deleted rows (2), not the total table size.**

---

## Case 8: TRUNCATE (What Doesn't Work)

```sql
TRUNCATE orders;
```

`TRUNCATE` does **not** fire row-level triggers. The change buffer receives zero entries. The next refresh cycle will detect no changes and skip the stream table.

This means the stream table becomes **stale** — it still shows the old aggregate values while the base table is empty.

**Workaround**: After a TRUNCATE, manually reinitialize:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.refresh_stream_table('customer_totals');
```

With the `FULL` refresh mode (or by setting the reinitialize flag), the stream table is recomputed from scratch, producing correct results.

> **Why no TRUNCATE support?** PostgreSQL fires statement-level `AFTER TRUNCATE` triggers, but they don't provide OLD row data. The trigger can detect that a TRUNCATE happened, but cannot enumerate which rows were removed. Supporting TRUNCATE would require reading the stream table to determine what to subtract — effectively a full refresh anyway.

## How DELETE Differs From INSERT and UPDATE — A Summary

| Aspect | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Trigger writes** | `new_*` columns only | Both `new_*` and `old_*` | `old_*` columns only |
| **new_* columns** | Row values | New values | NULL |
| **old_* columns** | NULL | Old values | Row values |
| **pk_hash source** | `NEW.pk` | `NEW.pk` | `OLD.pk` |
| **Scan delta output** | 1 INSERT event | 2 events (D+I split) | 1 DELETE event |
| **Aggregate effect** | Adds to group count/sum | Subtracts old, adds new | Subtracts from group |
| **Can delete a group?** | No (only creates/grows) | Yes (if group key changes) | Yes (if count reaches 0) |
| **MERGE action** | INSERT new row | UPDATE existing row | DELETE matched row |

---

## The Reference Counting Principle

The core insight behind incremental DELETE handling is **reference counting**. Every aggregate group in the stream table maintains an internal counter (`__pgt_count`) that tracks how many source rows contribute to the group:

```
Stream table internal state:
customer | total | order_count | __pgt_count (hidden)
---------|-------|-------------|---------------------
alice    | 80.00 | 2           | 2
bob      | 100.00| 2           | 2
```

- **INSERT** → `__pgt_count += 1`
- **DELETE** → `__pgt_count -= 1`
- **UPDATE** → `__pgt_count += 0` (D cancels I for same-group updates)

When `__pgt_count` reaches 0:
- The group has zero contributing rows
- The aggregate emits a DELETE event
- The MERGE removes the row from the stream table

This is mathematically rigorous — the stream table always reflects the correct result of the defining query over the current base table contents, incrementally maintained through algebraic delta operations.

---

## Performance Summary

| Scenario | Buffer rows | Delta rows emitted | Work |
|----------|------------|-------------------|------|
| Single row DELETE (group survives) | 1 | 1 (D) | O(1) per group |
| Single row DELETE (group vanishes) | 1 | 1 (D) | O(1) |
| N deletes same group | N | N (D) → 1 group delta | O(N) scan, O(1) per group |
| INSERT+DELETE same window | 2 | 0 (cancels) | O(1) |
| UPDATE+DELETE same window | 2 | 1 (D original) | O(1) |
| Bulk DELETE across M groups | N | N (D) → M group deltas | O(N) scan, O(M) aggregate |
| JOIN table DELETE | 1 | K (one per matched join row) | O(K) join |

In all cases, the work is proportional to the number of **changed rows**, not the total table size. Deleting 3 rows from a billion-row table produces the same delta cost as from a 10-row table.
